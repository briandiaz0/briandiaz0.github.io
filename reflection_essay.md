Reflection Essay Questions
==========================

Question \#1. Discuss one challenge you overcame during your academic development. What was the challenge, was it technical, nontechnical, or both, and how did you overcome it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the greatest challenges for me was coming into the field of computer
science without having any knowledge of computer science. I of course knew how
to work on a computer however I didn’t know the inner workings of what computer
science entailed. When I began the first couple of classes, I was introduced to
very basic coding and VB. I quickly learned it and aced the first couple of
classes. After the beginning courses, I felt like computer science was going to
be my calling and I felt good at it. The next intermediate computer science
courses that I took became a bit more difficult however I still aced them. I
learned that the professors had our best interest at heart and would help
whenever we reached roadblocks. I also learned that Google was also very helpful
as I am not the first computer scientist in the world and many others before me
have gone through similar errors. When code got difficult, I first tried trial
and error and error checking methods taught by my professors. If this would not
work, then I would ask my professor for guidance and my classmates as well. In
the last couple of courses for computer science, the classes got difficult. I
was balancing 5-6 classes and a full-time job. The sensation of hopelessness and
overwhelmingness got ahold of me. Another heavy task occured when all the documentation
fell on my lap, I had to create every file and test cases and product demos for my
team due to the lack of participation. Although it didnt affect me when my developers
didnt complete the project it was heavy helping in every field, even testing. This was
very overwelming and I had to spend time meditating and providing the best support I could.
This was very difficult but it didnt stop me. I didn’t let this hold me down however, I had
courage and I preserved through it, and with the help of my family, God, and my
own hard work I got through it. My family each day provides support and
encouragement, which they also pray for my future as do I for my protection and
theirs. Not only that but my hard work brought me here, I didn’t give up. As for
my final year as a senior, I will endure and achieve my goal of being a computer
scientist and being the first graduate in my Hispanic family.

Question \#2. Discuss a situation where you worked with a team. How would you describe yourself as a teammate? Where can you improve your team skills? Be specific.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This semester I have been working with a team of 6 students. The project we are
working on is from the System Analysis and Software Design class, which is CSCI
495-40. Much of the class is working on a group project where the client gives
the need for a web-based system and cloud-based database. Our group is assigned
to do documentation and production of their needs before the end of the
semester. The other part of the class is learning terminology and skills that we
will need when working as a computer scientist and other tech fields. My role in
this project is to produce, turn in, and complete documentation as well as help
the team lead communicate with the lead developers. I have been working
diligently and actively to get on every team meeting, communicate individually
with every member and even help with some error-checking on the project code. My
team has been happy that I have communicated actively and finished all my tasks
on time. I have been doing well so far however, I know I can personally do
better by providing more support to my team lead and giving out my ideas on new
group tasks. I always tend to be quieter and more introverted so working on
improving that would be a major milestone.

Question \#3. What type of career in CS do you believe you are most suited for? Why this field and not another? Be specific.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The type of career in computer science that I feel suited for is probably
software programmer. Eventually, I will want to go higher by becoming a software
engineer for Apple or even an Architect. I feel more interested in this field
because I like working on performance on programs and I always believe there is
room for improvement. All the aspects of MAC OS are interesting, and I could
provide improvements in their software and even the full process of hardware and
other system characteristics. I like seeing the whole process work together and
I hope to one day be a part of their Mac system performance team. The workload
is a lot when it comes to Apple but I’m willing to take on that task.

Question \#4. What professional organizations would you like to join? What professional development would you like to be a part of in the next five years? Be specific.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The professional organization that I would like to join would be Apple and the organization known as ACM. If I
were to join Apple, the professional development I would like to work on is MAC
OS or even iPhone’s IOS development. I am interested in seeing the overall
system and working more on its efficiency, performance, and capabilities. I like
how their systems feel innovative and their style is overwhelmingly fast yet
simple. I hope to one day have the requirements to be a part of the Apple team
and set a footprint on their innovations and designs. If I were to join ACM, I would help distribute and make known the importance
of diversity, equity and inlcusion. ACM helps computer programmers know their ethical guidelines and the correct practices
that should be practiced in every day programming. ACM isnt only the biggest computing organization it is the brightest with 
thousands of code experts willing to help and provide relationships beyond the simple introductions.

Question \#5. What are the ways you can use the skills you have learned in CS to serve your community? Be specific.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The skills I have learned at CSU CS have been plentiful. I can web-design and
create a full-stack website for small businesses or community needs. I can
provide basic C++ mini-games to young kids. I can provide knowledge of computer
networking and basic network security to my community. I can provide software
that could solve mathematical issues for college students or the community. I
have the skills to work on a group project and communicate efficiently. I can
work under deadlines and produce well-done essays and drafts. I am thankful CSU
has abundantly given me many skills throughout my education that I will help
provide to my community and my peers to help their lives and help others.
